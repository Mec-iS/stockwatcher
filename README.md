# A TDD exercise: 
## stock market reader/logger

Inspired by [**PacktPub's Test Driven Python Development**](http://www.packtpub.com)

To have an idea of what is going on, from the root directory:
```
python testing/tests_TimeSeries.py
```

## TO-DO:
* Write tests! (:


## Note
```
Main Pattern:

      -> Red: Arrange-Act-Assert
      |  Green
      |  Refactor ->-
      |              |
       ------<-------             
```

```
Refactoring:
- Rename variables and methods
- Make comments redundant by naming constants or using Enum
- Extract method refactoring
- Replace calculations with local variables
- Extract conditionals to methods
- Extract class
- Move method to class
```

```
Some vocabulary:
1. 'Test doubles':
- mocks
- stubs
- fakes
- spies
2. 'Patching'
```

# TODOs
* complete the Event() and Action() classes
