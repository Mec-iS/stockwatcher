A TDD exercise: a stock market reader/logger.

Inspired by PacktPub.com's Test Driven Python Development

To have an idea of what is going on, from the root directory:
```
python testing/tests_*someclass*.py
```

## TO-DO:
* Write tests! (:


## Note
```
Main Pattern:

      -> Red: Arrange-Act-Assert
      |  Green
      |  Refactor ->-
      |              |
       ------<-------             
```

```
Refactoring:
- Rename variables and methods
- Make comments redundant by naming constants or using Enum
- Extract method refactoring
- Replace calculations with local variables
- Extract conditionals to methods
- Extract class
- Move method to class
```
